    <!-- Congratulations on getting through to the technical round for internship at our company.

    We have a task/project for you for this round. In this task, you have to develop a dynamic dropdown list based on the JSON file shared:
    If we click on the India tab then all states should be showing.
    If we click on state then city falling then within that state should be displayed
    City and state should be selectable (you can use checkbox)
    If a particular state is selected then by default all the cities falling under the state should be selected.
    If we select a few cities within a state then the state should as well be selected.
    Develop a submit functionality wherein when clicked should return an output (all selected city and state) on console.
    The city should be searchable
    Note:
    A sample output is attached
    Can as well develop Node js API and integrated with frontend for extra points.
    Compulsory to use React and Redux to develop Frontend
    
    Date & Time of Submission: 24th December, 6 pm.
    
    Submission format: Push it over to Github and send the project link.
    
    Best of Luck! -->
